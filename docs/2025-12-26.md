# Pointers
- A pointer is just an addres to a piece of data in memory 
 - Ex: 32-bit computer, sees 32 0s and 1s as a unit, 64-bit computers, sees 64 1s and 0s as a unit.
 - Address in a 32-bit computer is a number bitween 0 -> 2^32 ...4 billion memory addresses
 - Address in 64-bit computer is a number between 0 -> 2^64 ... Really really big
 - A "memory adress" is jsut a number is that range 

- `&` - get the address of the variable 
 -when you do this , the address become "some pointer type"
- `*` - it depends in which side it is being used 
 - 'L' side (left side ) for declarations such as `int *x = 3`, we are saying that `3` is a memory address assigned to `x` which is a "pointer to an intiger"
  - Buy! if `a` is on the `l` side without declaration such as `*z = 78`, it means to modify the value located at the address of `z` to `78`.
 - 'R' - side (right side) such as `int y = *x`, means we are taking tha value stored at the pointer (address of) `x` meaning at location `3` and assigning it to `y`. for example , location `3` could be counting the value `1500`. So `y` has `1500`.
  - When * is on the `R` side, you can't jsut take the value of any variable. The variable has to be a "pointer type" - therefore something like `int z = *y` won't work becouse `y` is an `int` type not a `int *`.
